		<strong> 1. Service Connects Soulcrafters and Clients </strong>
		<p>
			The Service is a communications platform which enables the connection between Clients and Soulcrafters.
			Clients are individuals and/or businesses
				seeking to obtain contractor services (“Projects”) from Soulcrafters and are therefore clients of Soulcrafters,
				and Soulcrafters are individuals and/or businesses seeking to perform Projects (“Soulcrafters”) for Clients.
			Clients and Soulcrafters together are hereinafter referred to as “Users.”
		</p><br>



		<strong> 2. Service Only Provides a Venue </strong>
		<p>
			The Service is a platform for enabling connections between Users for the fulfillment of Projects,
				but Company is not responsible for the performance of Users,
				nor does it have control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of Projects,
				nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users.
			Company does not have control over the quality, timing or legality of Projects delivered by its Soulcrafters.

				and provided by Users identified through the Service whether in public, private, or offline interactions.
		</p><br>



		<strong>3. User Vetting</strong>

			Users hereby give consent to Company to conduct background checks as often as required in compliance with federal and state laws and the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
		</p>

		<p>
			Although Company may perform background checks of Users, as outlined above,
				Company cannot confirm that each User is who they claim to be and therefore,
				Company cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability identity or background check information or any information provided through the Service.
		</p>

		<p>
			When interacting with other Users,
				you should exercise caution and common sense to protect your personal safety and property,
				just as you would when interacting with other persons whom you don’t know.
			NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT,
				WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE SERVICE AND YOU HEREBY RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY RELATED THERETO.
			COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.
		</p><br>



		<strong>4. Billing and Payment</strong>
		<p>Users of the Service contract for Projects directly with other Users. Company will not be a party to any contracts for Projects or services.</p>
		<p>Users of the Service will be required to provide their credit card or bank account details to Company and the Payment Service Provider retained by Company (the “PSP”).</p>

		<p>
			Clients will be responsible for paying the invoice for each Project (the “Invoice”),
				which will include the pricing terms of the Project agreed with and provided by a Soulcrafter (“Project Payment”),
				any out of pocket expenses agreed with and submitted by a Soulcrafter in connection with the Project, any tip or gratuity, if applicable, 
				and the fee the Company assesses for the Service, based on the Project Payment amount.
		</p>

		<p>
			Soulcrafters may be required to register with the PSP, agree to Terms of Service of the PSP and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with the PSP.
			Terms of Service between Soulcrafters and the PSP retained by Company are <a href='https://squareup.com/legal/ua'>available (the “PSP Agreement”)</a>.
			By accepting these Terms of Use, each Soulcrafter agrees that they have downloaded or printed, and reviewed and agreed to the PSP Agreement.
			Please note that the Company is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that you, the PSP, and any other parties listed in the PSP Agreement (currently, Square, Inc.) are the parties to the PSP Agreement and that the Company has no obligations or liability to any Soulcrafter under the PSP Agreement.
		</p>

		<p>
			Within 24 hours after Client receives confirmation through the Service or via email that a Project or contractual milestone has been completed,
				Client authorizes Company to provide Client's payment details to the PSP for processing of Project Payment, 
				out of pocket expenses owed to Soulcrafter, any tip or gratuity, if applicable, 
				and any fees owed to Company for the use of the Service.
			You may be charged a cancellation fee through the PSP if you book a Project, but cancel it before it is completed, as set forth in the Project pricing terms.
		</p>

		<p>
			Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), to 
				(i) place on hold any Project Payment and out of pocket expenses, or
				(ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so.
		</p>

		<p>Project Payment and fees must be paid through the Service and may be paid using a Gift Card (see Section 5) in Client’s sole discretion.</p>
		<p>Users of the Service will be liable for any taxes (including VAT, if applicable) required to be paid on Services provided under the Agreement.</p><br>



		<strong>5. Gift Cards and Vouchers</strong>
		<p>
			Company gift cards (“Gift Cards”) and vouchers or promotional codes (“Vouchers”) may be available and can be used to pay Project Payments and Company fees in part or in full, 
				but may not be used to pay for reimbursement of out of pocket expenses and Company fees associated with a Project provided through the Service.
			Vouchers are an offer (subject to the terms of the voucher) by the Company to reduce the amount a Client has to pay in relation to a Project Payment and/or our fee.
			Vouchers will not affect the amount of the Project Payment a Soulcrafter ultimately receives.
			You agree that you will only use one Voucher per person, and will comply with Voucher terms,
				including but not limiting Voucher use to first-time Users 
				(which means that you will not use such a Voucher with a new account you create if you already have an account on the Service).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Client must enter each Gift Card into Client’s account for its appropriate value before Client can use that value on the Service.
		</p>

		<p>
			Gift Cards are not replaceable if lost or stolen and have no expiration date, but in certain U.S. states, after a period of time, we may remit the cash associated with unused Gift Card balances to certain states pursuant to their abandoned property laws.
			Once we have remitted such cash to a state, if someone tries to redeem the Gift Card, it may no longer be redeemed and we may direct them to that state’s government instead.
			Gift Cards have no cash value and are not redeemable for cash except in the following ten U.S. states where it is required by law to the extent noted below: California, Montana, Washington, Vermont, Maine, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Colorado, Massachusetts, and Oregon.
			If you are a resident of one of these U.S. states, and the balance on your Gift Card is less than the respective dollar amount below, you may redeem it for cash:

			The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online.
