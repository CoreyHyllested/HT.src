		Have you ever had to stop a project because it's not working out? It’s happened to us. A lot.
		<!--Ever start a project and stop because it's not turning out the way you planned? It’s happened to us. A lot.-->
		<br><br>
		One Pinterest fail after another, we realized some projects would be much easier if someone&mdash;a mentor&mdash;could help nudge us in the right direction. 
		We wanted a home for connecting, meeting, and learning from the cool, passionate, experts around us.
		A place we could find guidance for those pesky, hair-pulling moments.
		We wanted to empower local experts to impart their know-how, whether they were professionals or hobbyists, and get paid for it.  That was the birth of Insprite.
		<br><br>
		From making an amazing birthday cake to designing a patio to hacking a gardening project, we're showcasing local experts and mentors who offer in-person experiences you can't find elsewhere.
