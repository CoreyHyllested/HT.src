    Our Story
  </div>
 <div class="aboutStory">Ever start an artsy project and stop because it's not turning out the way you planned? It’s happened to us all too often.

We soemtimes found finding the correct nugget of information on the web or the right person with creative know-how was tough. We wanted an easy way of connecting, booking and learning from the cool, creative people around us. A place where we found find help getting started on something new or locating help for those hair-pulling moments. We also believed in empowering the makers, crafts and DIY enthusiasts to impart their knowledge&mdash;and get paid for it. 
From there, Insprite was born. 

From hacking a mason jar lamp to mastering linocut printmaking and more, we bring you a community marketplace connecting you to local maker artists who offer in-person, unique learning experiences you can't find elsewhere.
